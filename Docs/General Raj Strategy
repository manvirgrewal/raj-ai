A player's first thought before each game (or round of the game, or game-round - we tend to play many, many of these in a row) 
would be to realize how many points you'll need to win. 

In a 2-player game, you'll obviously need one more than half: 21.

Games with more players are less subject to exactness, but there can be some rules of thumb. 
In a three player game, you'll probably something like 14. With four, you'll need more than 11. 
With all five, you'll need at least 9.


More players mean that higher tiles are more important. Ie. 5 players, 10 tile might just win you the game.

There are only a few kinds of possible bids, really.

* Trying to win the tile by ONE more than an opponent
* Bailing on an auction to pitch your lowest card.
* Trying to win the tile for exact value (or less)
* Overpaying to be SURE to win a particular auction
* Attempting to tie on a negative tile
* Attempting to benefit from a tie by playing low-ish
