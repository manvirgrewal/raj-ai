Adaptive AI:
    Must become better the more games it plays.
        AI knowledge file: create, load, and update statistics
            Knowledge (statistics): 
                Game: What prizes are more likely to lead to winning (sum to the highest score)
                Opponent Plays: What cards do they "usually" play in different scenarios (high prizes, low prizes, negative prizes)
                Opponent Cards: Keep track of what cards everyone have already played (what cards they have left)
                                ie. if the opponent(s) have 'some' higher cards than you, play your lowest
                                when there is a high prize, because you are bound to lose anyways. saveCardsTurn()
                                ie. ai = [11k, 2k, 4k] p1 = [14k, 8k, 15k] prize = 6mil
                                ie. in this scenario, p1 will probably play 14k or 15k, so play 2k
                                if you know that other cards exist that will lead you to winning
                                ie. next turn: ai = [11k, 4k] p1 = [8k, 15k] prize = 10mil
                                ie. next turn: ai = [11k] p1 = [8k] prize = 5mil -- you will win this turn
                Future Prizes: Check if the current prize is better than the next ones
                Scores: Base choice on current scores. (If losing: acquire more high prizes. Else: save high cards)
